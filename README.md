We started our project during Summer of 2015. The Project's main objective is to simulate legendary Clavia Nord Modular G2 synthesizer using CSound language. The Project was first presented at the The Third International CSound Conference (2-4 October, St. Petersburg, Russia).


The modules of Clavia are modelled by CSound UDOs. See /Modules. The module numbers correspond to original Clavia numbers.

The patch format succefully decoded thanks to Michael Dewberry http://www.dewb.org/g2/pch2format.html

The output of our converter is csd file with all used UDO's and two separate instruments (VA and FX).

More detailed description will appear soon..
